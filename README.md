### plexinstall

## Description
Reinstalling PLeX Media server can be redundant when migrating to new hardware. Usually, you have to google around and dig for the resources. I made this mostly for myself. 

## What it does
1. Creates a plex directory in your home dir
2. Adds plex to your repo list so a `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade` will update the softare. 
3. Installs PLeX Media Server
4. Registers Plex Media Server as a service.
